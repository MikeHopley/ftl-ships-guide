Rush shields, then look for weapons. Finding weapons is not urgent though, as the Stun Bomb lets you beat any enemy in the game&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;[including the Flagship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4di0ohYcOs&t=9m55s)! If you’re still low on crew in the mid-game, buy some.

Hit early stores to fund your shield upgrades. Selling Lockdown Bomb and Mantis Pheromones gives you 47 scrap.

Although keeping both bombs does extend your tactical options, they mostly overlap in function. Either bomb is sufficient for boarding support. The Stun Bomb is more tactically useful, and also lets you break Zoltan shields.

Start the Mantis in the teleporter. Walk the Engi pilot to sensors during the FTL jump (force them to go the bottom route), and the Lanius from weapons to the teleporter (so the teleporter stays oxygenated). This gives you sensor information, and lets you board as fast as possible with either two or three crew.

Sometimes the safest option is the simplest: just kill the enemy crew as quickly as possible.

Boarding with all three crew often lets you disable clone/medbays without spending missiles. It can also be your most effective way to disable enemy weapons, using distraction tactics similar to Lanius B. Board shields, wait for all enemies to enter, then move two crew to weapons. All the enemy crew will stay in shields, giving you time to break at least one weapon. To extend your time punching weapons, swap healthy crew into shields (keeping one in shields at all times).

This tactic fails when enemies have three crew **and** a two-tile shields room. In some fights it’s also risky to leave your ship unattended. It may be safer to leave your Engi at home for repairs.

For even more time punching weapons, use your bombs tactically. Lockdown lasts for 12 seconds, and stun lasts for 15. You can stun all the enemy crew in shields; then if needed, use the Lockdown Bomb as well. Or lockdown weapons first, then stun the crew trying to break in. Or you might want to use the Stun Bomb on weapons, to switch off a dangerous weapon more quickly. There are many possible tactics!

With good timing, it’s possible to dodge all your crew out a room while stunning the enemy crew. Even just stunning your Lanius is effective: enemy crew will rapidly suffocate. Stunning them in an airless room can be more effective than attacking the medbay.

The Lanius cannot use the medical airlock, so try to limit damage to them or get them killed off just before the fight ends. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).

Note that stuns can be chained when manning weapons with level 1 training, and so can lockdowns with fully-trained crew (but only just, so occasionally enemy crew will get through). 

[Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/QALokZf.jpg): shields and weapons are vulnerable.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;maybe even better than a guaranteed fight, considering how useful extra crew are to this ship. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Engi (good) and teleporter (good for this ship).
