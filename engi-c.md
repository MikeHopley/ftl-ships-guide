Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. Hacking provides some safety, however, and you have a lot to sell. Sometimes it may be better to save for an early store.

Dual Lasers are great, but may eventually need to be replaced with more slot-efficient weapons. Defence Scrambler does almost nothing and can be sold immediately ([anti-drones are defeated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3whJB13ZKk&t=488s) with power micro).

At each fight, consider whether to use your beam drone, hacking, both&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or neither! Remember that preventing a damage cascade is more important than hoarding resources, and this is especially relevant while you only have 1 shield. It’s often best to use two drones early on, just look for opportunities where you can safely economise.

Choose your hacking targets carefully in the early game. Hacking weapons is tempting, as it lets you fire first; but this only gives you one (targeted) damage against enemy weapons and only if both shots hit. Hacking shields is often better, as it gives you two shots against enemy weapons and a way to do damage even if your weapons are taken out. On the other hand, hacking weapons is great when you can de-synchronise them.

Line up your drone early, as this gives a better chance to hit important systems. If it’s aiming at something useless, let it reposition while you wait for weapons / hacking.

Try crew kills when safe: hack O2 then immediately destroy it. Hacking often lets you farm crew skill early, by de-synchronising enemy weapons.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

Start your engines crew on sensors, as enemy crew composition may be relevant when choosing a hack target. Just remember to send them back!

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Engi (good) and drone (weak).
