Your offence is good initially, but terrible against two-shield enemies. You also have a weapons buffer for the Heavy Pierce. Delay shield upgrades enough to afford a weapon. Selling Rock Plating and Fire Bomb gets you 65 scrap, so you only need to float 15 scrap.

Heavy Pierce is good early on, but power-hungry and does not play well with beam weapons. The Fire Bomb can get some early crew kills, but only use it when you are safe. Avoid selling the Fire Bomb unless it gets you something important, as it can help you kill the Flagship crew.

By itself, the Fire Bomb is not that effective, except against Mantis. Enemies prioritise fighting fires, and can usually put them out efficiently. The explosion does 30 crew damage, but that’s a lot of missiles to kill crew directly. Soften them up with the Heavy Pierce first; either target crew directly, or maybe try for a breach in O2. Breaches attract a second crew once repaired, giving a chance to double your Fire Bomb damage.

It’s tempting to upgrade weapons early, so you can use them together; but this doesn’t improve your offence enough. That scrap is better saved for buying a weapon, a system, or shields-4. Mind control or hacking makes the Fire Bomb much better. Also consider a teleporter for Rock fire-boarding shenanigans.

Doors are much too expensive to buy. Note you don’t get airlocks, although hull breaches can be used. You *can* fire-bomb your own ship to help with boarding defence, but this is rarely useful. Mind control helps, especially against the Flagship. Phase 3 boarders can be rough without doors/venting, so you have extra incentive to kill the crew in phase 1; you can do this by fire-bombing shields, together with mind control or hacking.

Rock crew are good at putting out fires (67% bonus), but it’s important to stay on top of them. Fires can rage out of control in 4-tile rooms, so try to put them out quickly. In bad situations, turning off O2 can help fires burn themselves out faster.

You have level 2 oxygen, but without doors it can’t counteract a breach. The Flagship’s Boarding Drone may be annoying, so consider oxygen-3 if you already have everything else you need.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/FUSYVNi.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have blue options from Rock crew (good) and Rock Plating (okay).
