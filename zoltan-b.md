Shields-2 costs a whopping 100 scrap. Before then, your Zoltan Shield will serve well in most encounters, but you are vulnerable against asteroid fields and drones. Therefore your first 100 scrap should typically be spent on shields. It’s also reasonable to buy a weapon first, but only if it’s a great weapon (like a Flak 1 or Heavy Laser) or a useful cheap weapon (like another Ion Blast).

Do not buy engine upgrades before shields, even though they’re so much cheaper: you don’t even need evasion for most fights, and it won’t help you much in the really dangerous fights. Getting that shield up even one jump earlier could be crucial.

Once you have a regular shield, your Zoltan Shield and fantastic weapons make sectors 1 and 2 very safe. Consider delaying shields-3 and maybe shields-4, in the hope of finding a good weapon.

Before shields-2, consider avoiding nebula beacons, as they often have Auto-assaults (with drones). If you meet [the mercenary](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mercenary) early in sector 1, it might be worth paying for map data to avoid asteroid fields.

Use your weapons optimally against enemies with one shield. You can fire both ions immediately at weapons (or drones), and the Pike Beam will still do full damage before the shield comes up. On the second volley, you can sneak at least one ion inside the shield: micromanage them so both fire from the third weapon slot initially (giving a longer travel time), then bring them forwards for the second volley (be careful though: with a Zoltan in the room, weapons depower as you move them!).

When enemies have one shield and cannot harm you, try ionising O2 for a crew kill. You can also use the Pike Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), but the timing is quite difficult.

This ship is somewhat vulnerable to boarding. Start the engines Zoltan on doors (due to event boarding). Additional crew help, and the first gives one free power by replacing the pilot. If doors get boarded, you can vent them out and then reoccupy it. Consider pre-venting the three empty rooms to the right of doors (and then letting oxygen refill a bit).

Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) when you have multiple layers. Here’s a surprising fact about pulsars: even while you only have shields-1, a single Zoltan in the shields room will guarantee that the pulse hits the shield system (but probably it’s better to just send all three Zoltans into the weapons).

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/hUidgrH.jpg): weapons and drones are vulnerable.

Sector 1 distress beacons are somewhat worth visiting, mostly because they are not asteroid fields! You have one blue option from the Ion Blast (good, but just one event).
