Typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. Rushing shields gives more chances for early crew kills.

However, you do have a 30-scrap augment to sell, and generally you’re quite safe in early fights. Two Engis make fast repairs. So sometimes it might be better to delay shield upgrades slightly, and visit an early store.

Early on, [micromanage the drone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3whJB13ZKk&t=397s) to break a shield for your ion, which can then rapidly take down weapons. Against harmless ships, try ionising O2 for a crew kill. This does not need a drone part, but for level 2 or 3 O2 it can take a **long** time.

Late-game the Ion Blast 2 needs help from another ion weapon to reliably take down shields. This leaves only one slot for a hull-damaging weapon. Some combinations work, but don’t be afraid to ditch the ion in exchange for reliable damage-dealers.

Med-bot Dispersal is usually best sold. Take note of the [unknown disease event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Disease_on_Mining_Colony), however. With med-bots and medbay-2, this gives a high scrap reward and a weapon. This event occurs at distress beacons in Civilian, Pirate, Mantis, Rock, and Uncharted Nebula sectors.

Start your engines crew on doors. Just remember to send them back!

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, since Engi give good blue options.
