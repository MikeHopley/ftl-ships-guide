In early fights, typically use the Halberd and start the beam in shields for maximum damage. Be aware that some enemies (such as Rebels) are quite likely to have shields-3. Occasionally it may be better to open fights with a Leto to weapons, before switching to the Halberd; consider which weapon will be switched off. This is also good against Zoltan ships, as it allows your Halberd to [pierce into weapons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsY5J8t3_ok).

This ship seems very safe. Zoltan shield is good protection in most fights, the Halberd never misses, and the Leto is a backup if the Halberd goes down. In most fights you’ll take no damage. Therefore it’s tempting to hoard scrap and maximise the chance to buy offence. Hacking is especially good.

However, fights against drones and in asteroid fields can be dangerous. The Halberd suddenly becomes a liability when it’s taken offline before firing; again, consider opening with a Leto, though it’s very hard to judge when this is correct. I’ll consider the Leto more when the incoming damage is very fast, as that means a higher chance of losing the Halberd.

It’s a long walk from the piloting seat to help with repairs: in these fights, consider moving the pilot in advance. Your crew are frail, and fires or breaches in the weapons and shields can be serious trouble.

Given this danger, I now favour buying shields-3 immediately and then saving for offence. Weapons-4 may be safer than shields-3, but 35 scrap is a lot more than 20. You can get the shield buffer earlier, and having 15 more scrap at stores may be relevant. Nevertheless, I’d sometimes take weapons-4 instead&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;especially with map data showing no stores, and a high reward boosting scrap from sub-20 to 35+.

With the Zoltan Shield and the high utility of weapons-4, you can be flexible about subsequent upgrades. Often it makes sense to continue into shields-4, but other times it might be better to take weapons-4 first. If you pick up a weapon, you might even take weapons-5 before shields-4.

The Leto only sells for 10 scrap, so keep it unless it gets you a critical offensive improvement, or you just run out of weapon slots.

You start with only engines-1. Engines-2 and engines-3 are cheap and work well with the Zoltan Shield, but shields-4 is still better. Fit in engine upgrades later, when you can.

Your first extra crew member is worth one free power, replacing the pilot. Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) even when you have multiple layers.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

In sector 1, prefer unmarked beacons over distress. Your only blue option is from the Halberd (weak).
