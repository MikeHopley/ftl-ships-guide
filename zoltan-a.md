The Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, the Halberd never misses, and the Leto is a backup if your weapons get damaged. Therefore this ship has a very safe start. It’s also important to find hacking or shield-breaking weapons before sector 3. Delay shield upgrades enough to visit any store with 80 scrap.

Shields-4 is the next priority. You start with only engines-1. Engines-2 and engines-3 are cheap and work well with the Zoltan Shield, but shields-4 is still better. Fit in engine upgrades later, when you can.

Try to keep the Leto until you run out of weapon slots. It’s tempting to upgrade weapons early and use both together, but this delays shields-4 and could prevent you buying hacking.

In early fights, typically use the Halberd and start the beam in shields for maximum damage. Be aware that some enemies (such as Rebels) are quite likely to have shields-3. Occasionally it may be better to open fights with a Leto to weapons, before switching to the Halberd; consider which weapon will be switched off.

Your first extra crew member is worth one free power, replacing the pilot. Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) even when you have multiple layers.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

In sector 1, prefer unmarked beacons over distress. Your only blue option is from the Halberd (weak).
