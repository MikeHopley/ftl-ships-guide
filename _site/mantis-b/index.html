	<div class="flow content">
		<p>Despite its apparent strength, this ship is vulnerable at the start because Mantis crew are terrible at repairs and fire-fighting. Plan routes that let you revisit a previous beacon and repair after a disaster.</p>
<p>Mantis B’s nemesis is an Automated ship with a Small Bomb and Burst Laser 2. Even with <strong>perfect</strong> play, you’ll die about 1 time in 3. I’m not kidding.</p>
<p>The quickest fix is engines. Engines-2 increases your odds of survival to ~94%, engines-3 to nearly 100% and likely to take a lot less damage. If you see an immediate store, take it. You can sell Mantis Pheromones and buy engines-2, maybe engines-3.</p>
<p>After you’ve taken care of early-game safety, look for weapons, crew, or hacking. One-power weapons are particularly good, because you can use them immediately. A Small Bomb lets you disable enemy weapons (or medbays). An Ion Blast is cheap and lets you attack Zoltan ships.</p>
<p>Once you have three crew, you gain the option of using distraction tactics to break weapons (see Mantis C for an explanation).</p>
<p>The defence drone is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qSlV6gW.jpg">unreliable at protecting shields and drones</a>. On Hard, remove power from the drone before a missile fires, to reduce the chance of drones being targeted. Remove power from shields as well, if you don’t need them.</p>
<p>The boarding drone will eventually kill any automated ship, unless it lands in an isolated piloting room. That means it can kill 90% of automated ships, unless they are running away. With an upgraded teleporter, this becomes 100% with the help of your Mantis, but it’s not worth 30 early-game scrap. Regardless, consider avoiding nebula beacons early on.</p>
<p>When the drone starts leaving a room, you can sometimes make it change destination by toggling power. For example, when the drone lands in the shields room on an auto-scout, you can force its next room to be weapons instead of piloting.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to spend drone parts when fights look dangerous. Your boarding drone is not just for automated ships. A rapid crew-kill can be your best defence.</p>
<p>Precise venting helps against solar flares or fire-lighting weapons. Just before the fire starts, have no oxygen in the bottom-left corner, and switch off O2; but also close the doors. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47ENy6-CAM&amp;t=1m22s">Repairing O2 is possible</a> even in a fully-vented ship, providing you have medbay-2: you’ll need to run relays, and the timing is very tight.</p>
<p>Leave one Mantis in piloting (to start the FTL charging immediately), and put the other in sensors. This delays boarding by under 2 seconds, but occasionally stops you sending crew on a suicide mission. When completely safe, destroy systems for surrender offers (as low as 1 hull).</p>
<p>Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. Even without blue options, distress beacons can give crew, and are safer on average. The Boarding Drone has a low-scrap blue option.</p>
<p>You also have good blue options from the teleporter and Defence Drone, but they apply to <a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Small_Asteroid_Belt_Distress_Beacon">the same event</a>. The drone is typically better, but risks system damage with a fire; and the teleporter gives a 50% chance of crew. Therefore choose teleporter unless maybe you already got some non-Mantis crew.</p>
