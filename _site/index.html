<h2>About this guide</h2>
<p>This guide contains all kinds of tips, from basic strategy to extremely advanced micro.</p>
<p>Some tips are tiny optimisations that rarely matter. You may want to ignore them, depending on your skill level and how you prefer to play.</p>
<p>Less experienced players might find it overwhelming in places, especially <a href="/stealth-b">Stealth B</a>. I recommend skipping over the parts you don’t understand. You can always come back to them later.</p>
<p>My perspective here is wanting to win consistently on Hard, but most advice applies on lower difficulties too.</p>
<h2>Play the early game well</h2>
<p>To win consistently, you must play as “safely” as possible and get through the dangerous early game in good shape. To be “safe”, you need two things ASAP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two shields</li>
<li>Offence that works well against two-shield enemies</li>
</ul>
<p>“Offence” at this stage usually means a weapon, but it could be hacking, mind control, teleporter, or a combat drone. Hacking is especially strong. When I say “look for a weapon”, that’s really  shorthand for “look for a weapon, or hacking, or other offence”.</p>
<p>Ideally I like to start with a good weapon, then add hacking a bit later.  Prefer 1- or 2-power weapons that you can get online quickly.</p>
<h2>General early strategy</h2>
<p>For most ships and most runs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend your first 20 scrap on shields-3</li>
<li>Spend your next 30 scrap on shields-4</li>
<li>Then save for a weapon, or other offence</li>
</ul>
<p>Shields-3 provides a damage buffer, so your shield will not go down from (say) a Leto. Most of the time, you can get away without this; but it only takes one nasty fight where you lose 20 hull to make you appreciate the value of shields-3.</p>
<p>Don’t wait on power before buying shields-4. Having two shields makes you much safer in sectors 1 and 2. Power can come later, after saving for a weapon.</p>
<p>This strategy has a downside: it may stop you buying a weapon or system in a sector 1 store. A bad layout in sector 2 could prevent you from finding any stores, or the stores might sell nothing useful.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’s sometimes worth delaying your shield upgrades. There are two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get shields-3 immediately, but delay shields-4</li>
<li>Delay both</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also choose how long you delay them. You could delay just a few jumps, because you are circling around a store in the middle of the sector. Or you could wait for a store at the end of sector 1 or early sector 2.</p>
<p>In most circumstances — but not all, and it depends on the ship — I think it’s incorrect to delay shield upgrades more than a few jumps.</p>
<p><em>The <a href="https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_AI_Scout_carrying_Shield_Virus">shield hack event</a> is out there, waiting for you with a beam drone. It knows nothing of mercy, neither of fairness, nor yet charity; and in its lifeless eyes, the noble pursuit of win streaks is but a guttering candle, soon to be extinguished.</em></p>
<h3>What factors influence this decision?</h3>
<p>The biggest factor is what ship you are playing. Some ships have safer starts. Some ships are more desperate for additional offence. Some ships have more stuff to sell. These concerns often compete with each other.</p>
<p>When a ship starts with strong defence or offence, delaying shield upgrades is less risky. For example, Zoltan C is a lot safer because it starts with a Zoltan Shield and fast offence. Kestrel A and Rock A are a little safer, because they start with two-point weapons buffers for the Artemis. Federation C is not at all safe.</p>
<p>When a ship urgently needs extra offence, delaying shield upgrades is more worthwhile. Rock A needs to solve its missile problem fast.</p>
<p>When a ship has more stuff to sell, visiting early stores is more worthwhile and does not delay your shields as much. Rock A need only float 18 scrap to afford even a teleporter, but Kestrel A would need to float 80 for hacking or a full choice of weapons.</p>
<p>Beware greed. If you’re only in the market for top-tier weapons, it’s probably incorrect to delay shield upgrades. A good question to ask yourself might be, “if an early store had a Chain Laser, would I buy it?”</p>
<h3>Other strategies</h3>
<p>Engines-2 and engines-3 are useful and cheap. Fit them in when you can, but do not let them delay shield upgrades or stop you buying an important weapon. At 15 scrap, engines-3 competes with shields-3, and I think shields-3 is almost strictly better.</p>
<p>Note that shields-4 is <strong>much</strong> better than early engine upgrades, because it also lets you farm crew skill against enemies that cannot hurt you. 10% free evade is about 90 scrap value!</p>
<p>Piloting-2 can be tempting when you’re visiting nebula beacons without a clone bay, for a <a href="http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships">chance of a free weapon</a>. But this is very luck-dependent. That 20 scrap is better spent on shields-3.</p>
<p>Never waste early-game scrap on luxury purchases like medbay-2, doors-2, or Scrap Recovery Arm.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The Stealth cruisers have no shield system at all, and Zoltan B only has shields-1. Mantis B starts with shields-4.</p>
<p>The strategies for these ships are quite different, reflecting their special starting conditions.</p>
