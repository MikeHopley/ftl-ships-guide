The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, and you have little to sell, so typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. Your Zoltan can [power shields-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=1m59s) against ion.

Your strong offence also provides a degree of safety, however. Occasionally it may be better to save scrap for an early store, especially if early jumps drop vendor trash.

Ideally you want fast weapons to complement your remaining Basic Lasers. If you find only slow weapons, consider hacking or mind control instead, as this keeps your volley fast for longer. You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little early anyway.

Move the shield-room Mantis to doors initially. Put the Zoltan on engines; remember you can use them to [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s). Cooldown systems like hacking and mind control appear rather far away from the main systems, so power-stealing is awkward.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.
