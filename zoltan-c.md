This ship can have one of the toughest transitions into the mid-game, due to inital reactor costs and the starting ion/drone setup.

For example, on most gunships you’d be thrilled with a Flak 1, but on Zoltan C you’d still lack targeted damage. Getting a three-power weapon online together with the Charge Ion is also tough, and can leave you vulnerable in sector 3 with delayed shield upgrades or extremely low power.

Although it’s best avoided, do **consider** using the starting offence even through sector 3 if necessary. Depending on your store options and scrap, it may be better to get two shields up first, instead of a minor offensive improvement.

Zoltan Shield provides strong defence in most fights, and you kill early enemies quickly. Therefore delay shield upgrades and save scrap for a weapon.  Power constraints also make shields-4 less immediately useful, though still very good.

Once you have enough scrap for a store, consider buying a weapons buffer with any spare. Most early fights are safe, but you’re also somewhat fragile due to crew, layout, and power. The weapons buffer does a lot for safety without needing any power. This is a tricky judgement, as it might prevent you buying multiple weapons or hacking together with a weapon. I think this ship is safer than Zoltan A without the buffer, and also has more need to increase early options at stores.

Autofiring the ion on shields is not always the best tactic. Consider sending some ion into enemy weapons; this kills ships more slowly but can be safer. Micro the drone so it doesn’t waste time firing when their shield is up. Against enemies with two shields, fully charge the Charge Ion for the first volley to help it “stick” (and if you only hit one shot, start again).

When enemies can’t hurt you, train your crew and then try ionising O2 for a crew kill. It only works against level 1 O2, so watch the system icon: if a single hit makes it flash blue/grey, then it’s level 1. You’ll need to micromanage it, firing a full charge of 3 followed by a single shot to sneak inside the regenerating shield. Repeat until you die of boredom.

Delay using the backup battery as long as possible&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;usually after your Zoltan Shield goes down. Position the beam drone so it will fire the instant shields go down, then divert its power to engines. You do not need the battery for this! When the beam drone has started firing, cutting power will not interrupt its beam; you can micro that power to engines as a shot comes in.

With that in mind, consider your crew positions carefully, and move them around as needed. You can start two Zoltans in weapons, with the other two in engines and piloting. This is simple and flexible. When fights drag on and your battery is about to run out, consider moving the pilot into drones.

For better defence in boarding events, you can start one of the weapons Zoltans in the bottom-left corner of drones (where they can dash into doors).

The clone bay is vulnerable to event boarding; pre-vent it, then let oxygen refill to 90%. This lets you vent the clone bay in 4 seconds using 4 airlocks. If you forget to do this, you can use all 6 airlocks (venting through weapons too). In both cases, turn off O2.

Charge Ion is the best ion weapon in the game. Adding another 2-power ion weapon will take down shields reliably for the whole game (even a 1-power ion will do, especially mid-game). Hacking somewhat overlaps with the ion cascade, but is still very strong. For example, hack shields and ionise weapons.

Early reactor upgrades are expensive. In the early game, avoid buying more than you absolutely need. You can get by with much less than you might think, for quite some time. Your first extra crew member gives one free power (replacing the pilot).

Don’t forget that two Zoltans can completely [ion-proof one shield layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=3m15s), and can also [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) when you have multiple layers.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from Charge Ion (good) and the drone (weak).
