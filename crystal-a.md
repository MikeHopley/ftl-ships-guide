Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. You have a lot to sell, however, and a 2-point weapons buffer for the Heavy Crystal gives some safety. Consider delaying shield upgrades if you see an early store.

If weapons are thin, seriously consider a teleporter. Two Crystal crew make a strong boarding party. Each lockdown lasts 12 seconds; when enemies have two crew, you break 3 weapons bars in ~19 seconds. You can break weapons faster/more by adding mind control, hacking, upgrading teleporter, or just using your weapons.

Crystal weapons are powerful (early on) but slow, and don’t play nicely with beams. Defence drones shoot them down! Depending on setup, both weapons can be kept until the end of the game; but Heavy Crystal is the better one.

Bear in mind that Engi and Rebel sectors have a higher chance of defence drones. Be particularly careful with the Virus event Engi blue option&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if you can’t kill the ship, you lose the Engi!

Sell Crystal Vengeance at the first store you visit.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/CEsuzYp.jpg), as weapons are vulnerable.

Crew positions are hard to decide. I like Crystals in piloting and weapons, with humans in engines and doors. Piloting and weapons are good rooms for lockdown, and spreading humans around the ship means more flexibility for repairs and fighting fires. This isn’t ideal for boarding, but if you cross-train it doesn’t matter.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.
