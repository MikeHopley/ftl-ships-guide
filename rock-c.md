You have a 2-point buffer for the Heavy Crystal. Consider delaying shield upgrades, in the hope of finding a good weapon. Floating 8 scrap lets you buy any good weapon if you sell Swarm Missiles. Floating 40 lets you keep them; or compromise and float 25, which lets you buy most weapons and still keep them.

Weapons are good early on, but a little awkward to upgrade. In particular, Heavy Crystal doesnâ€™t play well with beams. Although inaccurate against small rooms, Swarm Missiles can fire before almost any enemy weapon. Use them to reduce damage and risk, especially early on.

Remember to use your Crystal tactically when defending against boarders! You have good boarding crew, so a teleporter is a good fallback plan if weapons are lacking.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual. [Defence drones cover this ship well](https://i.imgur.com/xtqlP7k.jpg), as all rooms are outside the blind spot.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from Rock crew (good) and Rock Plating (okay).
