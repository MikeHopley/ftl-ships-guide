This ship starts vulnerable, due to weak offence that goes offline with a single hit. Enemies may escape and double the fleet pursuit, so plan your jumps with this in mind.

Typcically rush shields, then look for a weapon. Consider teleporter as a  fallback plan, since you start with decent boarders. 

If you have a convenient store, and especially with stuff to sell, it might sometimes be worth delaying shields. You could potentially buy a 1-power weapon and upgrade weapons next.

Opening with a weapons buffer is also a good option, but I *think* the shield upgrades are safer overall ([explanation](/#weapons-buffer)). Do get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might stop you buying a weapon.

Artillery is nice late-game if you have scrap to spare, but expensive to upgrade earlier. A single upgrade may sometimes be worthwhile, as a damage buffer. Against the Flagship, expect it to hit 5 rooms. Beware enemies running away: when possible, manage the artillery power so that it’s ready to fire immediately after your weapons hit, or vice-versa.

Since artillery uses a system slot, you can only pick two more systems. [Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/Y92J2ml.jpg): weapons and drones are vulnerable.

For crew positions, I like: Rock piloting, Mantis engines, Human weapons, Engi starting on doors. The Engi should be mobile for repairs, and can move to shields if doors aren’t needed. Piloting is awkward to vent, so the Rock’s fire-immunity and 67% fire-fighting bonus is helpful. Weapons is a high-priority room to repair, so I prefer the Human over the Mantis here.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting. You have good blue options with Engi and Rock crew, and a weak one from the Artillery. A guaranteed fight is probably still better.
