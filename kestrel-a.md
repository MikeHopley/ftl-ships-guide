The starting weapons can handle two-shield enemies, and you have nothing to sell, so typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. However, you also have a 2-point weapons buffer for the Artemis, which gives a degree of safety. Occasionally it may be better to save scrap for an early store, especially if early jumps drop vendor trash.

Conserve missiles, but do use the Artemis against threatening weapons. Keep the Artemis unless you need the slot or absolutely need the scrap. If you find no weapons but do get crew, consider buying a teleporter: the Artemis provides good boarding support.

Consider running your pilot to doors during the jump, and your engines crew to the empty room below weapons: the engines crew may stop event boarders getting into weapons. Maintaining the weapons manning bonus ensures your Burst 2 finishes firing before an unmanned Artemis lands, and maybe even before a manned Artemis lands.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

You have no blue options for distress beacons in sector 1, so prefer unmarked beacons.
