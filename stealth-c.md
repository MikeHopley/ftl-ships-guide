Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also bad, since they have a higher chance of enemies with drones. Look for flexible routes, so you can avoid these hazards without losing beacons. Consider avoiding nebulas too, as they often contain Auto-assaults&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but plasma storms are worth trying, for the [incapacitated ships event](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Plasma_Storm_Incapacitated_Ships).

Put the Slug in piloting. Put the Rock on weapons, because the central location offsets their slow movement; weapons is also an important room to repair, and Rocks have a hidden 67% bonus to fire-fighting. The Human can start in doors, and quickly move to engines.

[Use your Shield Drone precisely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KrfF8NN3yQ). Against Zoltan Shields, use [precise beam placement and timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPji41olyFM&t=5m39s) to help disable weapons.

As with Stealth B, keeping oxygen below 50% decreases the chance of weapons being hit.

As with Stealth A, your starting weapons can be kept for the whole game, if you get hacking; alternatively, you can replace one or both with something harder-hitting, like a Halberd. The Mini Beam can hit four rooms on many ships.

Your strong weapons are your best defence, so spend your first 25 scrap on weapons-3 as a damage buffer. Typically buy shields next, and then look at improving offence or upgrading to shields-4. It’s also reasonable to buy a weapon before shields, so consider doing this if you find something like a Flak 1. Also remember you can use the Mini Beam [as an Anti-bio Beam](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/72lds2/every_beam_can_be_an_antibio_beam/), increasing the value of shields-4.

Drones-3 is tempting, as it gives your Shield Drone a damage buffer. It also lets you run both drones together, which helps in fights against combat/beam drones. But it helps much less in other fights. Weapons-3 protects you in every fight and will definitely be used later&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whereas you might sell one or both drones to afford shields! So on balance, I’d rather buy weapons-3 and then save for a store.

At pulsars, a single Zoltan Shield layer will completely absorb the ion pulse. Bizarrely, [this only works when you have a shields system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcfjeR9GIhQ&t=3m45s). Before then, pulsars will *ignore* the Zoltan Shield.

Sector 1 distress beacons are well worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You have a clone bay, plus blue options from the Rock (good), Slug (weak), and beam (weak). Note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.
