This ship starts vulnerable due to weak offence. Enemies may escape and double the fleet pursuit, so plan your jumps with this in mind.

Typically rush shields, then look for a weapon. Your Zoltan can [power shields-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=1m59s) against ion.

If you have a convenient store, and especially with stuff to sell, it might sometimes be worth delaying shields. You could potentially buy a weapon and upgrade weapons next.

Opening with a weapons buffer is also a good option, but I *think* the shield upgrades are safer overall ([explanation](/#weapons-buffer)). Do get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might stop you buying a weapon.

Leto is weak but worth keeping unless you need the slot for something else. Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship; almost always keep them.

[Defence drones cover this ship poorly](https://i.imgur.com/TpuD5BE.jpg): shields and weapons are vulnerable.

Put the Slug in piloting, and the Zoltan in weapons: they can [de-ionise shields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpR3veZtlsc&t=52s) and steal power from mind control or hacking, which are slotted nearby (although cloaking slots next to engines). Consider starting the engines crew on doors; just remember to send them back!

The layout is a little awkward, but you can still vent shields or weapons in under 3 seconds by using **all** airlocks and turning off O2.

Artillery is nice late-game if you have scrap to spare, but too expensive to upgrade earlier. Against the Flagship, expect it to hit 5 rooms. Beware enemies running away: when possible, manage the artillery power so that itâ€™s ready to fire immediately after your weapons hit, or vice-versa.

In sector 1, prefer unmarked beacons over distress. Your have weak blue options from the Slug and artillery.
