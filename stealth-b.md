Put the Zoltan on engines. They can steal power from cloaking.

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also very bad. Try to avoid nebulas too, as they disable your sensors and often contain Auto-ships.

Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Try to plan a route that lets you retreat to a previous beacon. This gives you a safe place to recover after a disaster. Also plan around doubled fleet pursuit.

Usually start the Glaive in shields, for maximum damage. Sometimes it’s better to start in weapons or drones; for example, a manned Heavy Laser may fire before your Glaive finishes. Against Zoltan Shields, use [exact beam placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ8uLSidl7o) to damage weapons.

The ideal upgrade path is:

* Cloaking-3
* Hacking
* Shields

Spend your first 50 scrap on cloaking-3. This lets you kill most enemies before they can fire, by cloaking first. The Glaive falls off hard against 2 shields, so try to get extra offence before sector 3. Hacking is by far the best option.

If hacking is not offered, generally buy shields. Buying shields significantly increases your chance to find hacking later. Also consider buying backup battery. If the next store is selling systems, its chance to sell hacking is *approximately*:

* 33% if you bought no systems
* 40% if you have backup battery
* 50% if you have shields
* 60% if you have both

The most difficult choice is between shields and a weapon. Usually take shields. Even a Burst Laser 2 is somewhat risky without shields, because unlike hacking it can miss. Shields make you a lot safer, especially once upgraded&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but that’s another 50 scrap into defence that won’t help you kill 3-shield enemies in sector 4.

2-power weapons are very expensive to get online (165 scrap for weapons-6 and power), so generally prefer 1-power weapons. An Ion Blast 1 is especially good, because it’s cheap. Spending less scrap on weapons gives you a better chance to switch into hacking later.

Also consider replacing the Glaive with another weapon that you can get online sooner; ideally still keep the Glaive for later, but sell it if necessary. For example, something like Flak 1 + Hull Laser 1 requires no upgrades and can last a long time.

At intervals, consider buying a weapons buffer. Early on there are more important uses of scrap. However, if you pick up a two-power weapon, it may be worth buying the buffer while you wait.

Protect your weapons by checking where combat drones are aiming before you cloak. Only cloak if they are about to hit weapons, cloaking, or possibly sensors. Otherwise, delay your cloak until enemy weapons fire. Even then, wait to see whether weapons are targeting anything important. Ideally you’ll let them hit irrelevant rooms, to reduce the chance of the drone sniping your Glaive when cloak ends.

All drones hit the exact centre of the target room, but beam drones do not “line up” at the exact angle they will fire, making them harder to predict. Beam drones can drag into an adjacent room. Beam 1 drones cannot drag across the “long side” of a room (their beam is shorter than 1 tile), but Beam 2 drones can. It’s worth knowing the odds of a bad drag:

* Beam drone 1:
  * From sensors, 13% drag into cloaking
  * From the empty room above weapons, 7% drag into weapons
* Beam drone 2: 
  * From doors, 53% drag into weapons
  * From weapons, 33% drag into cloaking
  * From cloaking, 27% drag into weapons
  * From the empty room above weapons, 27% drag into weapons
  * From sensors, 27% drag into cloaking

It’s also worth knowing how fast they attack, to help decide when to cloak. On average:

* Combat 1 attacks every 2.9 seconds
* Combat 2 attacks every 1.9 seconds
* Beam 1 attacks every 3.6 seconds
* Beam 2 attacks every 4.4 seconds

Mini Beam into cloaking has a 40% chance to drag into weapons. Cloaking is less likely to be targeted when on cooldown, so you should pre-cloak the Mini Beam (unless perhaps that stops you cloaking another weapon). This also gives the best chance of running away.

If your weapons *do* get hit, don’t just rush all your crew to repair them. Keep the FTL charging, and also try to repair cloaking. The correct repair priorities are very difficult to judge, and depend on the situation. If you jump away with critical systems damaged, jump to a known safe beacon.

Later on, with fully-trained weapons crew, you do not need to delay firing the Glaive against enemies with cloaking: it can hit them exactly as they enter cloak. Practise your weapons or hacking timing against non-cloaking enemies. Similarly, a pre-ignited Glaive can fire immediately against cloaking enemies (notably shieldless auto-scouts).

Watch out for *Pirate* Mantis Interceptors, because you can’t hit both shields and weapons. Consider this when a fight is optional.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You have blue options from cloaking (okay, good once upgraded) and the Glaive Beam (weak). Note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.

## Hard-mode trickery

On Hard specifically, enemy targeting can be manipulated to reduce the chance that your weapons or cloaking get hit.

Run the weapons crew to sensors to watch weapons charge. Depower your Glaive when the charge bar is full, then repower when the charge bar resets. This [drastically reduces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7q5ko0/optimal_strategy_for_early_game_stealth_b_runs/) the chance of weapons being targeted, from 31.5% to 6.5%.

Note that you can’t use the sensors trick in a nebula! This is another reason to avoid them. Also consider that a drone hit into sensors effectively makes enemy weapons more dangerous.

Venting below 50% oxygen makes enemies less likely to target cloaking. It also reduces the chance of weapons being targeted to 14.8%, but that’s only relevant if you can’t toggle the weapons power. Venting also has some risks, for example if your O2 gets hacked.

For that reason, vent precisely. Before jumping, drop O2 to 75%. Then vent the 4 empty rooms in the top part of the ship, with O2 off. This gets you under 50% O2 in ~6 seconds, or ~3 seconds if you also vent the airlock below engines. You can then decide whether to vent at the start of a battle.

Wait to see where enemy hacks land before venting. Get your weapons crew near a door. Remove power from rooms before they get hacked, especially weapons (on the first hack).

### *Now you’re just being silly*

Consider walking your engines Zoltan around the ship for timing the sensors dash. You can use my [Zoltan treadmill](https://mikehopley.github.io/zoltan-treadmill/) for accurate timing.

It’s even possible to time enemy weapons purely with crew movement and weapon animation (and this can potentially be used by *any* ship). This means you can continue using the trick when sensors don’t work, such as in a nebula. It means you can let beam drones hit your sensors without cloaking.

In most cases this will charge your Glaive slightly faster too. This can sometimes matter more than you might expect. [For example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwB5uSMNpM), an unmanned Small Bomb will explode just *after* your Glaive finishes firing.

Use crew movement to time the weapon charge and de-power, wait for the weapon to “go green”, then re-power on the *next* animation frame. For missiles and bombs, listen for the firing sound.

When you don’t know the type of missile, de-power and wait a few frames to see if it turns green. Bombs are easy: they start animating before charge resets. Flak doesn’t have a “green” frame; just re-power on the first animation.

Occasionally, it might be better to station the Zoltan in sensors, for the absolute minimum loss of charge time. For example, consider an Ion Blast and Burst Laser 2. With **minimal** interruption, a manned Glaive will usually *start* firing before an *unmanned* Burst 2 shot lands. This gives you the option of cloaking the ion if it’s heading into weapons or cloaking. The same approach could also work against unmanned Heavy Laser + Burst 2, when the enemy weapons room is directly next to their shields.
