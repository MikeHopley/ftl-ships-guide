## Avoiding and recovering from disasters

Plan your jumps carefully, to avoid being forced into asteroid fields. Suns and pulsars are also very bad. Try to avoid nebulas too, as they disable your sensors (see below) and often contain Auto-ships.

Look for flexible routes, so you can skip these hazards without losing beacons. Try to plan a route that lets you retreat to a previous beacon. This gives you a safe place to recover after a disaster. Also plan around doubled fleet pursuit.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting, but guaranteed fights are better. You have blue options from cloaking (okay, good once upgraded) and the Glaive Beam (weak). Note that Long-Ranged Scanners effectively decrease the value of unmarked beacons.

If your weapons *do* get hit, don’t just rush all your crew to repair them. Keep the FTL charging, and also try to repair cloaking. The correct repair priorities are very difficult to judge, and depend on the situation. If you jump away with critical systems damaged, jump to a known safe beacon.

## When to skip fights

Some events let you “preview” a ship before you choose to fight it. Which fights should you take?

A hyper-cautious approach would avoid all fights with drones, at least before you get cloaking-3. This is safest in the short term, but you risk falling too far behind. You must evaluate each fight, but here are some guidelines:

Take fights against Rebel Riggers more willingly than against Auto-assaults. Auto-assaults always have offensive drones, but Riggers may have defensive ones instead. Beware Rebel Disruptors though, as they can have both drones and hacking!

Don’t just consider the drones, but also the weapons. An Auto-assault with a Heavy Laser and a Mini Beam is incredibly dangerous. The same ship with an Ion Blast and a Basic Laser is much less threatening, despite the drones. The most dangerous weapon is a Mini Beam.

If a scary-looking pirate is [offering you a bribe](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Bribing_You_for_Unknown_Ship), probably just take it. Fighting only gives a 40% chance of getting an additional scrap reward, though there’s also a chance of 15 hull repair.

Consider the event reward. An Auto-assault guarding a [storage cache](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Automated_Ship_Near_Storage_Vessel) is worth more than one guarding a [sensor station](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/Rebel_Automated_Ship_Near_Sensor_Station), which is worth more than one [that’s deactivated](https://ftl.fandom.com/wiki/De-Activated_Rebel_Automated_Scout).

Watch out for *Pirate* Mantis Interceptors, because you can’t hit both shields and weapons.

## Basic combat

Put the Zoltan on engines. They can steal power from cloaking.

Usually start the Glaive in shields, for maximum damage. Sometimes it’s better to start in weapons or drones; for example, a manned Heavy Laser may fire before your Glaive finishes. Against Zoltan Shields, use [exact beam placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ8uLSidl7o) to damage weapons.

Later on, with fully-trained weapons crew, you do not need to delay firing the Glaive against enemies with cloaking: it can hit them exactly as they enter cloak. Practise your weapons or hacking timing against non-cloaking enemies. Similarly, a pre-ignited Glaive can fire immediately against cloaking enemies (notably shieldless Auto-scouts).

## Upgrade strategy

The ideal upgrade path is:

* Cloaking-3
* Hacking
* Shields

Spend your first 50 scrap on cloaking-3. This lets you kill most enemies before they can fire, by cloaking first. The Glaive falls off hard against 2 shields, so try to get extra offence before sector 3. Hacking is by far the best option.

If hacking is not offered, generally buy shields. Buying shields significantly increases your chance to find hacking later. Also consider buying backup battery. If the next store is selling systems, its chance to sell hacking is *approximately*:

* 33% if you bought no systems
* 40% if you have backup battery
* 50% if you have shields
* 60% if you have both

The most difficult choice is between shields and a weapon. Usually take shields. Even a Burst Laser 2 is somewhat risky without shields, because unlike hacking it can miss. Shields make you a lot safer, especially once upgraded&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;but that’s another 50 scrap into defence that won’t help you kill 3-shield enemies in sector 4.

2-power weapons are very expensive to get online (165 scrap for weapons-6 and power), so prefer 1-power weapons. Spending less scrap on weapons gives you a better chance to switch into hacking later.

Also consider replacing the Glaive with another weapon that you can get online sooner; ideally still keep the Glaive for later, but sell it if necessary. For example, something like Flak 1 + Hull Laser 1 requires no upgrades and can last a long time.

At intervals, consider buying a weapons buffer. Early on there are more important uses of scrap. However, if you pick up a two-power weapon, it may be worth buying the buffer while you wait.

## Specific weapon tactics

Correctly timed, a Heavy Laser can take down two shield layers. The Glaive needs to damage shields just before the laser connects. This won’t work when the enemy has a shield buffer (shields-5).

The same applies for Ion Blast or Ion Stunner. These are even better, as you can fire them ahead of time for a second chance to hit. An Ion Blast can even drop unbuffered three-shield enemies down to one shield if both shots connect.

With full weapons training and a third weapon, an Ion Stunner can do the same. Fire it from the back, then bring it forwards for the second shot. A Reloader also works.

## Dealing with drones

Protect your weapons by checking where combat drones are aiming before you cloak. Only cloak if they are about to hit weapons, cloaking, or possibly sensors. Otherwise, delay your cloak until enemy weapons fire. Even then, wait to see whether weapons are targeting anything important. Ideally you’ll let them hit irrelevant rooms, to reduce the chance of the drone sniping your Glaive when cloak ends.

All drones hit the exact centre of the target room, but beam drones do not “line up” at the exact angle they will fire, making them harder to predict. Beam drones can drag into an adjacent room. Beam 1 drones cannot drag across the “long side” of a room (their beam is shorter than 1 tile), but Beam 2 drones can. It’s worth knowing the odds of a bad drag:

* Beam drone 1:
  * From sensors, 13% drag into cloaking
  * From the empty room above weapons, 7% drag into weapons
* Beam drone 2: 
  * From doors, 53% drag into weapons
  * From weapons, 33% drag into cloaking
  * From cloaking, 27% drag into weapons
  * From the empty room above weapons, 27% drag into weapons
  * From sensors, 27% drag into cloaking

It’s also worth knowing how fast they attack, to help decide when to cloak. On average:

* Combat 1 attacks every 2.9 seconds
* Combat 2 attacks every 1.9 seconds
* Beam 1 attacks every 3.6 seconds
* Beam 2 attacks every 4.4 seconds

## Hard-mode trickery

On Hard specifically, enemy targeting can be manipulated to reduce the chance that your weapons or cloaking get hit.

Run the weapons crew to sensors to watch weapons charge. De-power your Glaive when the charge bar is full, then repower when the charge bar resets. This [drastically reduces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/7q5ko0/optimal_strategy_for_early_game_stealth_b_runs/) the chance of weapons being targeted, from 19% to 6.5%. **I’ll refer to this de-power trick as “toggling” your Glaive.**

Note that you can’t use the sensors trick in a nebula! This is another reason to avoid them. Also consider that a drone hit into sensors effectively makes enemy weapons more dangerous.

Venting below 50% oxygen makes enemies less likely to target cloaking. It also reduces the chance of weapons being targeted to 14.8%, but that’s only relevant if you can’t toggle the weapons power. Venting also has some risks, for example if your O2 gets hacked.

For that reason, vent precisely. Before jumping, drop O2 to 75%. Then vent the 4 empty rooms in the top part of the ship, with O2 off. This gets you under 50% O2 in ~6 seconds, or ~3 seconds if you also vent the airlock below engines. You can then decide whether to vent at the start of a battle.

Wait to see where enemy hacks land before venting. Get your weapons crew near a door. Remove power from rooms before they get hacked, especially weapons (on the first hack).

### *Now you’re just being silly*

Consider walking your engines Zoltan around the ship for timing the sensors dash. You can use my [Zoltan treadmill](https://mikehopley.github.io/zoltan-treadmill/) for accurate timing.

It’s even possible to time enemy weapons purely with crew movement and weapon animation (and this can potentially be used by *any* ship). You can use this when sensors don’t work, such as in a nebula, and you can let drones hit your sensors. It also charges your Glaive slightly faster, which might be relevant against drones or specific weapons.

Use crew movement to time the weapon charge, de-power the Glaive, wait for the weapon to “go green”, then re-power on the *next* animation frame. For missiles and bombs, listen for the firing sound.

When you don’t know the type of missile, de-power and wait a few frames to see if it turns green. Bombs are easy: they start animating before charge resets. Flak doesn’t have a “green” frame; just re-power on the first animation.

## Early-game tactics for specific enemy weapons

All these tactics assume you’re playing on Hard and using the advanced tricks described above. With that as a baseline, we can make more specific analyses.

***This section is a work in progress. It’s extremely complicated and makes my head hurt.***

### Small Bomb (unmanned)

For an *unmanned* Small Bomb together with a faster weapon, [use the Zoltan Treadmill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwB5uSMNpM). With perfect timing, your Glaive will finish firing before the bomb explodes.

### Mini Beam

Mini Beam into cloaking has a 40% chance to drag into weapons. Cloaking is less likely to be targeted when on cooldown, so you should typically cloak before the Mini Beam fires. This also gives the best chance of running away, because at least you get 10 seconds of cloak time.

### Burst Laser 2 (unmanned)

Now it gets complicated.

*With no interruptions*, your Glaive finishes firing before an unmanned BL2 hits. However, toggling the Glaive usually lets the BL2 hit before you can fire, or at least before you can *finish* firing.

Consider BL2 + Heavy Laser. The Heavy Laser forces cloaking if it heads towards *either* weapons or cloaking. Toggling the Glaive has almost no benefit here, because you protect weapons at the expense of cloaking. Toggling only drops the chance that *either* system is hit from 5.9% to 5.1%.

So toggling the Glaive makes the Heavy Laser microscopically less dangerous, while making the BL2 much more dangerous. It’s better not to toggle, and make the BL2 safe. The same logic applies to Ion Blast + BL2.

What about Ion Stunner? Toggle, and cloak both weapons together. Although this gives an extra 3 chances to target your weapons, it also means hits to cloaking are not a threat. The overall chance works out around 5.2% to hit weapons, which is marginally safer while also saving hull.

What about Leto missile or Basic Laser? You cannot cloak both weapons, but you can allow hits to cloaking. Currently I think toggling weapons and cloaking the BL2 is best. ***But I need to calculate this.***

What about Mini Beam? Toggle weapons and cloak the BL2. Pre-cloaking takes cloaking off the priority list and raises the chance of the Mini-Beam directly hitting weapons from 6.5% to 20%.

What about a Small Bomb? Pre-cloak without toggling, and you finish firing before either weapon can hit.
