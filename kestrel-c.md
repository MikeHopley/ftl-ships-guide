You have little to sell, and a single hit to weapons makes your offence very weak. Typically rush shields and then look for a weapon. Rushing shields also means more chances for early crew kills.

Since your offence is bad against two shields, it might sometimes be better to delay shields and look for an early weapon. One good compromise could be to rush shields-3 but delay shields-4.

Opening with a weapons buffer is also a good option, but I *think* the shield upgrades are safer overall ([explanation](/#weapons-buffer)). Do get the weapons buffer when you can, but not if it might stop you buying a weapon.

Dual Lasers are fantastic on a 4-slot ship. The Ion Stunner can help you get crew kills: destroy O2, then stun the crew repairing it.

Consider your weapon timing. Itâ€™s often best to fire them at the same time. If all shots hit, the Dual Lasers will take down one weapon, and the ion will disable the second (even a two-power weapon).

Put the Lanius on piloting, to protect it from boarders and help with nearby venting. Pre-vent nearby rooms, then allow them to refill slightly: refilling makes it easier for other crew to distract your Lanius if they get mind-controlled.

With a Lanius and clone bay, venting below 50% oxygen is reasonably safe. Consider doing this in the early game, to increase the chance that enemies target O2 instead of something that matters.

You have three empty system slots to fill, so try to buy your first system a little earlier than usual.

Sector 1 distress beacons are worth visiting. You have a clone bay and a good blue option from the Ion Stunner.
